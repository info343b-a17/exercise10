# Exercise Set 10

This repository contains practice exercises for the [Client-Side Web Development](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118282) course at the UW iSchool.

To complete this exercise set, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file for each problem.

## Checking Your Work
This exercise comes with a suite of _unit tests_ that you can use to check your work and understanding. Tests are **not** guaranteed to be comprehensive.

In order to run these tests, you will need to have the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) test runner installed **globally**. You will also need to install the test dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

```bash
npm link jest  # make jest available as dependency
npm install
```

You can run these tests by using the `jest` command from the repo's root directory, specifying the problem to test as an argument:

```bash
# run tests for problemA
jest problemA

# run tests for all problems
jest
```
